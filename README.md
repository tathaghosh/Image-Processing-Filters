# Image-Processing
Implementing the Image Processing Filters:

1. Luminance Operations:
Brightness: Change the brightness of an image by scaling RGB values by a factor.
Contrast: Change the contrast of an image 

2. Linear Filtering Operations:
Blur: Blur an image by convolving it with a Gaussian low-pass filter.
Sharpen: Apply a linear sharpening filter to the image.
Edge detect: Detect edges in an image by convolving it with an edge detection kernel.

3. Resampling Operations:
Scale: Scale an image up or down in resolution by a real valued factor.

4. Composite Operations:
Composite: Compose one image with a second image using the over operator, with a third image
as a matte (alpha).
